Tokenization is crucial for AI models.
SentencePiece is a popular subword tokenization algorithm.
It is used in many natural language processing tasks.
Subword tokenization helps to handle unknown words.
This is a sample dataset for SentencePiece.
We are training a custom tokenizer.
The vocabulary size is set to 5000.
SentencePiece supports byte-pair encoding (BPE).
It also supports unigram language model.
