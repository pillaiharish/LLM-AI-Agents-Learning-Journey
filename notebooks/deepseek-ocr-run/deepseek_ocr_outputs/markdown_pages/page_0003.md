wise fully connected feed- forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(\(x + \mathrm{Sublayer}(x)\)), where \(\mathrm{SubLayer}(x)\) is the function implemented by the sub- layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub- layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension \(d_{\mathrm{model}} = 512\) .  


Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of \(N = 6\) identical layers. In addition to the two sub- layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub- layer, which performs multi- head attention on top output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub- layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self- attention sub- layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with last that its output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions of position \(i\) can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than \(i\) .  


### 3.2 Attention  


An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key- value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.  


#### 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention  


We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot- Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension \(d_{k}\) , and values of dimension \(d_{v}\) . We compute the dot products of the
